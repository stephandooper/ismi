    "# Histopathologic Cancer Detection: Check.\n",
    "In this competition, you must create an algorithm to identify metastatic cancer in small image patches taken from larger digital pathology scans. The data for this competition is a slightly modified version of the PatchCamelyon (PCam) benchmark dataset (the original PCam dataset contains duplicate images due to its probabilistic sampling, however, the version presented on Kaggle does not contain duplicates).\n",
    "\n",
    "PCam is highly interesting for both its size, simplicity to get started on, and approachability. In the authors' words:\n",
    "\n",
    "[PCam] packs the clinically-relevant task of metastasis detection into a straight-forward binary image classification task, akin to CIFAR-10 and MNIST. Models can easily be trained on a single GPU in a couple hours, and achieve competitive scores in the Camelyon16 tasks of tumor detection and whole-slide image diagnosis. Furthermore, the balance between task-difficulty and tractability makes it a prime suspect for fundamental machine learning research on topics as active learning, model uncertainty, and explainability.

The train_labels.csv file provides the ground truth for the images in the train folder. You are predicting the labels for the images in the test folder. A positive label indicates that the center 32x32px region of a patch contains at least one pixel of tumor tissue. Tumor tissue in the outer region of the patch does not influence the label. This outer region is provided to enable fully-convolutional models that do not use zero-padding, to ensure consistent behavior when applied to a whole-slide image.\n",
